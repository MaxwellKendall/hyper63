# hyper63 default adapters

In hyper63 an adapter is a plugin that adds implementation details to a given port or service. For example, the data service contains a port that specifies how the data service calls a data store, the adapter implements the
port specification. This directory contains the default hyper63 implementations, but there will be many more
created in the community.
